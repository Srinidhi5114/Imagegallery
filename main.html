      <div class="text">Flowers, also known as blooms and blossoms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants.
				 Typically, they are structured in four circular levels around the end of a stalk.
				  These include: sepals, which are modified leaves that support the flower; petals, often designed to attract pollinators;
				   male parts, where pollen is presented; and female parts, where pollen is received and its movement is facilitated to the egg. 
				   When flowers are arranged in a group, they are known collectively as an inflorescence.</div>

      <div class="text">A cartoon is a type of visual art that is typically drawn, frequently animated, in an unrealistic or semi-realistic style. 
		The specific meaning has evolved, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire, 
		caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. 
		Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a cartoonist,
		and in the second sense they are usually called an animator.</div>

      <div class="text">The definition of tall building is ambiguous in design practice.
		 We normally define building below eight stories as low-rise buildings. For building with 8 and 20 stories it is called mediate-rise building.
		  For building over 20 stories it is called tall building. However, with the fast development of modern construction technology, 
		increasing number of supertall buildings was built and is going to be built. </div>
